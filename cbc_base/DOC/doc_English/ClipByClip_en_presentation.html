<h2>Clip By Clip</h2>

This application (which works only on the desktop) is proposed as a tool to improve the understanding of a foreign language.
<p>Allows you to watch a video or listen to an audio in small pieces with or without subtitles
(see <a href="doc_en.html">doc_en.html</a>).

<div style="width:100%; text-align:left;">
<img src="4_en_select_only_1_line.png" style="width:70%">
</div>
<p>
The application includes two parts: construction (<b>builder</b>) and use (<b>player</b>).
<br>
The first (builder) is used to build two customized files which together make up the player and which are used to play the chosen video or audio.
<br>
Video or audio files and subtitle files (of type <b>.srt</b>) must be located in a folder on your computer.
<br>The translated subtitle file can be obtained from the original language ones using an automatic translator (beware of the size limit, eg Google translates 5000 characters at a time).
</p>
<p><i>Warning this application does not create subtitles and does not perform any translation.</i> </p>

<big><b>Getting started:</b></big>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- download the software to a folder on your computer (e.g. c:\antonio\ClipByClip )
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- download the video or audio file to a folder (e.g. c:\antonio\English_lessons\video\my_video.mp4)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- download the subtitle files to a folder (e.g. c:\antonio\english_lessons\subtitles\my_en_video.srt, c:\antonio\english_lessons\subtitles\my_en_video.srt )
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In the <b>cbc_base</b> folder click on the <b>start.html</b> file.
A page will appear asking (<b>Choose file</b>) to specify video or audio files and subtitle files (the translation file is not mandatory).
<br>
Finally, two files will be downloaded to the download folder whose names include the title and
  one ends with <b>.html</b> and the other with <b>.jstxt</b>.
<br>These two files can be left in the download folder or moved to another folder for example in the video folder, in any case they must always stay together.
<br>
<br>Run the downloaded file whose name ends in <b>.html</b> by clicking on it.
<br>The video <b>player</b> will appear immediately ready to use.
<br>If after closing the application you later want to resume your previous work, you will find yourself at the point where you left off and with any
  customizations made (e.g. text and background color, possible synchronization of subtitles).
 
   <p><i>
          The application was developed and tested on PCs with Windows 10.
          <br>It has been successfully tested with Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Brave.
          <br>Does not work with Internet Explorer.
          <br>It's written in HTML and native Javascript so it should work with most modern browsers (2015 update).
<p>Theoretically it should work with other operating systems as well, but it has only been tested on Window 10.

<p>
This <b>ClipByClip</b> application that I initially wrote for my personal use in 2021 and then modified to make it usable by anyone,
<br>
can be freely downloaded and used.
